- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in
future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable
with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

For further development, I would focus on polishing the responsive design as
this is the first time getting exposed to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me
  immensely as the documentation had easy and clear styling and animation
  examples, and I will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article
  which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still
  learning this concept.
