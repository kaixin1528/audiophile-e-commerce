## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

For further development, I would focus on polishing the responsive designs, especially for tablet, as
this project is my first time attempting to optimize the layout for different screen sizes.

Another thing I would like to work on is improving the animation on some of the components, 
for instance making the drop down menu slide down gradually or incorporate a locomotive scroll in which 
the images ease in slowly by the time I scroll down to their sections. 

Lastly, this project is great for backend development, so I believe I will come back to this project to
work on the backend side when I feel comfortable in applying those required tech.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me
  immensely as the documentation had easy and clear styling and animation
  examples, and I will use it going forward.
